## Business Overview/Problem
**Manila** experiences rapid shifts in property values due to factors such as urban development projects, changes in local ordinances, and shifts in buyer preferences. Staying abreast of these trends and accurately predicting their impact on property values is a complex endeavor.

The value of a property is often influenced by hyper-localized factors like school district quality, proximity to amenities, and neighborhood safety. Capturing and quantifying these qualitative variables in a systematic manner is a challenge.

RealEstateBud faces a critical challenge in accurately valuating properties in the ever evolving real estate market of Manila. The dynamic nature of the real estate market makes it increasingly difficult to provide precise property valuations. Inaccurate valuations can lead to either missed opportunities for clients or overpriced listings that remain stagnant in the market. This challenge has the potential to erode client trust and hinder the company's growth and profitability.


## Rationale for the Project
**Multiple Linear Regression** is a statistical method that enables the modeling of complex relationships between multiple factors and a single outcome variable. In the real estate domain, it allows for the consideration of numerous variables, such as property features and location, to provide a comprehensive approach to property valuation.

RealEstateBud's challenge of accurately valuating properties in a dynamic market is effectively addressed by Multiple Linear Regression. It accommodates the diverse array of factors affecting property values, such as location, building features, access to public transportation, proximity to amenities and city center, e.t.c., to predict the price of properties. By employing this technique, RealEstateBud can create a precise valuation model, meeting the demand for accurate and transparent property pricing in a concise and efficient manner.


## Aim of the Project
The project focuses on utilizing a data-driven approach to property valuation at RealEstateBud in Manila. The primary goal is to create a robust valuation model utilizing Multiple Linear Regression, incorporating a number of factors. This model aims to significantly enhance the accuracy and transparency of property valuations, bridging the gap between estimated and actual property values.

Furthermore, the project emphasizes adaptability and scalability, ensuring the model remains effective in the face of evolving market conditions and applicable across various property types and market segments. By providing clients with a reliable decision-making tool, RealEstateBud aims to streamline the transaction process, enabling buyers and sellers to make informed choices. Ultimately, the implementation of this advanced valuation model is poised to bolster RealEstateBud's competitiveness in the real estate market, attracting and retaining clients while driving sustained business growth and profitability.

## Project Scope
A. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Carry out basic exploration of the dataset to check for dirty or inconsistent data. Perform summary statistics of the outcome variable to understand the range of values it contains. Create a correlation matrix to analyze the relationship between the explanatory variables and the response variable.

B. **Model Development:** Build the  Multiple Linear Regression model using the Analysis Tool-Pak in Microsoft Excel. Create a residual plot to validate the model.

C. **Model Evaluation:** Once the model is developed, it is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics and validation techniques.
